interupt script wihtout modifying it


virtual machine
- software emulation of computer system
- one host pc can run multiple guest vm on its hardware
- each is independent 
- sandbox environment and isolation
- run different os
- test insecure operations
- effectivly use computer hardware ressources, save costs on power, cooling and physical space
- managed by hypervisor
- development and testing
- support legay applications
- security research and analysys -> analyze malicious software, test different configurations
- easy to backup, clone, restore, recover

why debian?
- rocky is designed as enterprise operating system -> here no enterprise environment
- ubuntu closer to debian
- debian is very old and establsihed -> many free available packages

LVM, Partitions, Encryption, Mountpoint
- LVM abstraction layer above hard drives
- combine multiple physical into one logical
- easy snapshots as backups
- sliced writing -> write to multiple hd at once -> faster
- storage is easy to extend without unmounting everything

Difference between apt (advanced packaging tool) and Aptitude
Apt:
- high level cli for package management system
- intented as end user interface, not as specialised as apt-get and apt-cache
- standard packaging tool on debian distros
Aptitude:
- text-based interface to the Debian Package System
- view and manage packages
- either command line or visual user interface
- more features than apt

- when package conflict, apt wont fix issue, aptitude will suggest resolution
- aptitude allows to search for packages
- can resolve complex dependency issues

Apparmor
- linux security module
- additional layer of access control and confinement for processes and applications running on a system
- not each application can write, read, delete everywhere
- improve system security and damage that can be done by malcious software
- profile based
- restrict network access
- restrict inter-process communication
- easy to use

SSH
- Secure Shell
- cryptographic network protocol
- securely access and manage remot systems over unsecured network
- secure and encrypted communication between client and server protecting data like credentials
- client-server-model
- encryption
- authentication (password, public key, certificate based)
- setting up only specific ports for access
- transferring files

UFW
- uncomplicated firewall
- user-friendly front end for managing iptables
- simplyfied syntax
- cli interface
- default deny - block anything unless explicitely allowed
- application specfic profiles possible -> open ports only for certain appplications
- compatible with iptables
- log firewall activity
- includes pre configured profiles
- preinstalled on debian

why sudo
- superuser do
- run commands with root priviledges without logging in as root
- asks for password more frequently -> be more aware of destructive power one has compared to root
- notification if doing potential dangerous stuff
- retricting superuser priviledges only to certain users is more secure
- prevent accidental system damage and reduce security vulnerabilities
- granular access control - only allow certain administrative commands
- log all commands executed as sudo -> audit trail
- sudo is password protected
- user can be held accountable for sudo commands executed
- dont accidentally run harmful root commands

passwd policy pros + cons
- password are hard to crack
- user are forced abide to rules
- risk of users only using one password for everything or writing down passwords

tty
- teletype
- refers to physical or virtual terminals used to interact with systems
- physical tty
	- in the past physical terminals to interact with mainframe computers
- virtual tty
	- multiple virtual terminals on linux machines
-tty -> print filename of current terminal
- standard interface for input and output

cron
- time based scheduler
- run cronjobs in specific time intervals
- display system information, do backups, synchronise data
- crontab to store schedule and commands for cron jobs
- can be user or system wide
- system wide cron directories etc/cron.daily cron.weekly cron.monthly
- system maintenance -> clean temp dirs
- scheduled reports
- backups
- system updates

libpam-pwquality
- enforce password quality requirements and policies
- part of pluggable authentication module (PAM)
- PAM userd in linux for user authentication
